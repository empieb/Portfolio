# SeniorProject

This repository captures the code used for my Senior Project (Smart Package Delivery Box) in college. 

**Please note, the code is very much in an unorganized state as we were on a very strict timeline. Priority was given to produce a working project on time by the deadline and thats what we did. Given more time, I would have structured it much better and commented all lines. I have left it in the same condition it was in when the project was presented and demonstrated on 22 April 2022**

Main - The is the main program file that was setup to run on a Raspberry Pi using autostart \n 
BlinkM - Imported into main, this file contains functions for the BlinkM Smart LED
Keypad - Imported into main, this file contains functions for the keypad
Final Report - This represents the culmination of work and research that my partner and I put into the project. It also captures some of the key elements of project management and the programming techniques we used throughout the project.
